var introduction = "JSLab is a simple web page that has a thin android app as "

+ "web page is rendered.<br>"
+ "It was born from the desire to have a slightly more capable calculator app "
+ "available and the author then just took the path of least resistance.<br>"
+ "JSLab lets you enter JavaScript code which is then passed to the <b>eval()</b> "
+ "function and the result of the call is presented as output.<br>"
+ "In the end this gives you the whole WebView, an almost complete "
+ "browser, to play around with which is good";

var evaluation = "The code is passed verbatim to eval() and the result is set as innerHTML on "
+ "the output DIV - unless the result has a property tagName (i.e. a DOM node). "
+ "In that case the output DIV is replaced with the result. "
+ "Delete the input and press enter to delete an input/output pair. ";
